# advent-of-code-2022
csj's attempt to solve the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

I look forward to the Advent of Code contest every year. Not because I am competing for glory on the leaderboard (there's no way I'm going to be up at midnight to crack open the puzzles), but more to apply my mind to some abstract and fun problems. I find it's a good opportunity to make use of my favourite programming language, Kotlin, which I don't get to use for my day job.

I came across a [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/11/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin/) by JetBrains suggesting they were encouraging the use of Kotlin, so I was in. I took a quick look at the project template they had, decided to build my own infrastructure instead, and off we went.

I'll be doing little write-ups about each solution as I do them; they are listed [here](./writeups). Enjoy!
